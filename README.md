1.Importing Libraries
The necessary libraries such as pandas for data handling and sklearn, tensorflow for preprocessing and model building are imported.

2.Loading the Dataset
The dataset is read using pandas.read_csv() and stored in a DataFrame for analysis.

3.Exploring Categorical Variables
Unique values in categorical columns like course_type and gender are explored to understand the data.

4.Label Encoding
Categorical features (course_type, gender) are encoded into numeric values using LabelEncoder to make them suitable for model training.

5.Dropping Irrelevant Features
The student_id column is dropped as it is just an identifier and does not contribute to prediction.

6.Checking for Null Values
The dataset is checked for missing values to ensure data quality.

7.Statistical Summary
Descriptive statistics of the dataset are generated to understand feature distributions and value ranges.

8.Feature and Target Separation
The dataset is divided into features (x) and target (y). The target variable is dropout.

9.Train-Test Split
The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split for model validation.

10.Model Building with TensorFlow
A deep neural network is created using the Keras Sequential API, consisting of multiple dense layers and dropout layers to prevent overfitting.

11.Model Compilation
The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer, Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as a metric.

12.Model Training
The model is trained on the training data for 50 epochs with a batch size of 32, and validated on the test data.

13.Model Evaluation
The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated on the test set using R-squared and Mean Squared Error to assess prediction accuracy.
